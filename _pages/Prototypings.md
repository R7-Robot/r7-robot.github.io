During my undergraduate studies majoring in robotics engineering, I had the pleasure of founding and leading an undergraduate robotics innovation group named CP-Robot. Together, we had the opportunity to design and build several cool robots, encompassing mechanical designs, sophisticated algorithms, and system integration. These projects allowed us to participate in and win several international and national robotics competitions.


## Service Robot Seeker

The Service Robot Seeker is a mobile robot designed for human-robot interaction, providing various services to assist people in their daily lives.

### Key Features
- **Basic Semantic Navigation**: Equipped with semantic mapping and navigation capabilities, allowing the robot to understand and navigate different environments efficiently.
- **Human Following**: Implemented human-following algorithms to enable the robot to track and follow individuals, ensuring seamless interaction and assistance.
- **Human Finding**: Integrated vision and sensor systems to detect and locate humans in the environment, enabling the robot to approach and interact as needed.
- **Calendar Reminder**: Developed a calendar reminder system that alerts users of their scheduled tasks and appointments, integrating with popular calendar applications for synchronization.
- **Object Detection and Delivery**: Utilized machine learning models for object detection, allowing the robot to identify and interact with various objects in its surroundings.
- **Additional Features**: The robot also includes functionalities like voice recognition, task scheduling, and real-time feedback to enhance user interaction and satisfaction.
