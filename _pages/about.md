## Hello! 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, where I work in the [Smart Machine And Robotics Technology (SMART) Lab](http://www.smart-laboratory.org/) with Professor [Byung-Cheol Min](http://www.smart-laboratory.org/group/bcm.html). 

My primary research centers on developing **Adaptive Human-Robot Systems** to facilitate the seamless integration of robots into daily human life. I mainly investigate adaptation mechanisms across three key dimensions:

- **Team Heterogeneity**: How to optimize human-robot teaming by accounting for inherent yet heterogeneous human capabilities (e.g., cognitive abilities, skill levels, backgrounds) and robot characteristics (e.g., mobility, sensory abilities, autonomy levels) within specific task contexts?
- **Operational Dynamics**: How to enable proactive perception and responsiveness to human states (e.g., cognitive load, fatigue), robot working conditions, and task status that evolve dynamically during operation?
- **Individual Preferences**: How to personalize robot interactive patterns to individual preferences through human-in-the-loop learning?

Spanning scales from _one-to-one human-robot interaction_ to team-level coordination in _multi-human multi-robot teams_, my work aims to lay the foundation for a future where robots can naturally understand, adapt to, and collaborate with any human, in any context or situation.

My broad areas of research include:
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Human-in-the-Loop Robot Learning
- Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teaming
- Multimodal Perception and Reasoning
- Affective Computing
- Foundation Models for Robotics
