## Hello! 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Smart Machine and Assistive Robotics Technology (SMART) Lab](http://www.smart-laboratory.org/) 
at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/),
advised by Professor [Byung-Cheol Min](http://www.smart-laboratory.org/group/bcm.html).

My primary research interest is adaptations in human-robot interaction and teaming. 

Specifically, I focus on developing adaptive human-robot systems capable of adapting to:
  - Inherent heterogeneity of humans in terms of their abilities and backgrounds.
  - Ever-changing human states, such as cognitive load and fatigue.
  - Individual human preferences for personalized robot interactive behaviors.

My broad areas of research include:
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Multi-Human Multi-Robot Teaming
- Human-in-the-Loop Robot Learning
- Multimodal Perception and Reasoning
