## Adaptive Multi-Human Multi-Robot Systems
Multi-human multi-robot (MH-MR) teams are emerging as promising assets for tackling complex and expansive missions, such as environmental monitoring, disaster recovery, and military operations. The collaboration of multiple humans and robots with diverse capabilities, expertise, and characteristics presents great potential to enhance team complementarity, productivity, and versatility. However, this inherent heterogeneity within the team also introduces coordination challenges. Moreover, incorporating human operators as the core of the decision-making process can significantly improve the situational awareness and flexibility of the team, but it also introduces more uncertainty and complexity. Human affective conditions, such as cognitive load and emotion, as well as performance, are inconsistent and susceptible to various internal or external factors.

To unlock the full potential of MH-MR teams, this project focuses on developing adaptive systems capable of initializing mission-specific MH-MR teams by considering the inherent heterogeneity, proactively monitoring and analyzing the cognitive and emotional states of operators, and enabling both humans and robots to adapt to each other's states. Specifically, we aim to:

- Develop sophisticated initial task allocation (ITA) strategies that adapt to team heterogeneity. These strategies will optimally initialize task distribution by allocating and scheduling a variety of tasks, each with unique specifications, to a team comprising multiple humans (each influenced by varied factors) and multiple robots (each with different characteristics).

- Build multimodal human state recognition models that reason in real-time about the cognitive load and emotional states of human operators using various physiological and behavioral signals.
- Develop affective controllers that enable adaptive task re-allocation and adjustments based on the perceived human states.
